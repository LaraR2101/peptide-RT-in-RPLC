Machine Learning approaches to predict Peptide Retention Time in Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography 

Group project between 4 people

Parts done by me:

Data distributions analyis

Data Preprocessing (Andromeda score cutoff and different duplicate removal strategies)

Input feature engineering including creation of amino acid coefficients using SVR

SVR and some Random Forest Models
